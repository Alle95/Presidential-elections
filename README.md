Create a web application where visitors can register and participate in presidential elections.

Each user will have a profile page where they can put a short description.

Every user can submit his candidacy in the presidential elections.

Each user can view the list of candidates who have applied and in addition can see their user profile.

The rest of the users will have the private profile and only themselves will be able to see it.
